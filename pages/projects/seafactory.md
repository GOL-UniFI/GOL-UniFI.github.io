# OptimalSeaFactory Project

## AI-Powered Decision Support for Fish Farming

---

## Overview

OptimalSeaFactory is an optimization system designed to improve efficiency in open-sea fish farming operations through intelligent harvest planning and automated sorting configuration.

**Completed:** September 2020

## What has been done

### 1. Smart Cage Selection
Determines which cages to harvest from and how much fish to extract based on:
- Daily customer orders (weight ranges + quantities)
- Statistical distribution of fish in each cage
- Optimal matching between supply and demand

### 2. Sorting Optimization
Configures automatic sorting equipment (up to 6 channels) to maximize order fulfillment and minimize waste.

---

## Technology

- **Platform:** Ubuntu Server, Python 3
- **API:** RESTful web services
- **Optimization:** Pyomo framework + optimization solver

---

## Key Results

✓ Statistical modeling of fish weight distributions

✓ Multi-cage optimization significantly outperforms single-cage strategies

✓ Automated sorting configuration reduces waste and improves fulfillment

✓ Real-time decision support through API integration

**Example Performance:**
- Two-cage optimized solution: perfect match across all weight classes
- Single-cage alternatives: substantial mismatches and waste

---

## Innovation

The system uses advanced mathematical optimization enabling:
- Accurate harvest predictions
- Optimal resource allocation
- Minimized deviation from customer requirements 

---

## Status & Future

**Current:** Research prototype suitable for academic use and proof-of-concept

**Potential:** Commercial deployment, multi-species support, real-time farm integration
